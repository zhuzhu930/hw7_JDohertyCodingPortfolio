## Updated GitHub Profile

Employers (and potential collaborators) _will_ look at your GitHub profile, so put your best face forward.

Your GitHub profile must contain at least the following items:

1. Profile picture or avatar

- A photo or an avatar other than the default Github identicon. (a semi-professional to professional photo or an avatar photo are preferred)

2. Biography

3. Email address. If you don't want to share your personal email or phone number, use a developer email.

4. Link to your deployed portfolio

5. At least 2 pinned repositories:

   - Navigate to [GitHub](https://github.com/) and go to your profile.

   - Click "Customize your pins"

   - Click the checkboxes for your project and 2-3 homework assignments that you would like to share

6. Follow a few of your classmates and/or other developers. They are the beginning of your professional network and being a developer is as much about being a part of the community as it is writing code.

7. README files. Every pinned project should contain a README file with:

   - Title of app

   - Live link to deployed app

   - List of technologies used

   - 1-2 sentences explaining what the app is

   - 2-3 Screenshots / gifs of the app

   - License (usually MIT)

   - Contact information for you and any collaborators

8. Commit history. Every pinned repository should have at least 20 commits.
